London hotel staff trip to Hong Kong

The management team at the London hotel have decided to reward their staff by offering a week-long trip to the hotel in Hong Kong for £600. The visit will also enable the participating staff to see how successful the Hong Kong hotel has been in meeting the needs of guests. The trip will take place in October when the London hotel will be less busy. I am keen to encourage younger members of staff to go on the trip. This chart displays the amount left to pay by each member of staff who is less than 30 years old.
