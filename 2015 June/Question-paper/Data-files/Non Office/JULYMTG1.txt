Special offer
I have been analysing the data we hold about our guests and have compared it with some data I have obtained from other hotels. I am concerned that we are not attracting as many 50 to 60 year old guests as some of our competitors. This database extract shows the guests in this age range who have stayed in our hotels. As you can see, the number is quite low. I will telephone these guests and ask them what we can offer to attract more people in the same age range.
