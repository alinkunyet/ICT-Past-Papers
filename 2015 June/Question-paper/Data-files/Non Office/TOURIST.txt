Shore Temple

One of the oldest structural temples in Southern India is just a short drive from the hotel in the town of Mahabalipuram. The temple was built in the 7th century and features three shrines to Hindu deities. Also in the town are some magnificent carvings known as The Five Rathas. These were carved from the hillside around 1300 years ago. In the town you can purchase examples of stone carvings made by local students.


HONG KONG

Victoria Peak

Victoria Peak is the highest point in Hong Kong. It is accessible by one of the world's oldest and most famous funicular railways. The railway rises to 396 metres (about 1,300 feet) above sea level. It climbs so steeply past apartment buildings that they look like leaning towers. When you reach the summit there are magnificent views over the harbour and the city. There are also fabulous shopping and entertainment facilities including many excellent restaurants.


LONDON

Big Ben

London has so many exciting places to visit that it is difficult to pick out one highlight. However, one of the most iconic is Big Ben at the Houses of Parliament. Many people mistakenly think that Big Ben refers to the clock tower but it is actually the name of the large bell inside. The Houses of Parliament are where the Government of the United Kingdom holds its meetings. There are two chambers called the House of Commons and the House of Lords.
