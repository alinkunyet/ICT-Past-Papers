Title:	Report for the June Management Board Meeting

Paragraph 1: Rental Income
I have analysed the number of rentals during April. The graph shows that we are renting out at least 30 bicycles of each type each week. Our best performing bicycle type is the Speedster which had nearly 200 rentals during the month. The bicycle type with the worst performance was the Family Tandem. This could be due to the age of some of our bicycles in this range.

Paragraph 2: New bicycle
I have added a new bicycle to our range since our last meeting. I have managed to obtain a Mountain Chaser which I have called Silver Sprite. I have added a page to our website which gives details of the bicycle. Here is a copy of the page I produced.

Paragraph 3: Replacing older bicycles
I have previously mentioned my concern about the age of some of our bicycles, especially in the Family Tandem range. You will see from this extract of our database a list of bicycles in this range which were bought before the beginning of 2013. I think that we need to consider replacing these since they are becoming less profitable for the company.

Paragraph 4: Bicycle tour of Yorkshire
I have started to organise a bicycle tour of Yorkshire. I have obtained favourable rates for meals and accommodation and have managed to keep the costs down so that the charge to customers will be £300. This will still make a small profit for the company. I have been asked by Crixtren Cyclers to go to speak with them about the tour. Here is a copy of one of the slides I will be using in the talk. The slide gives details of the route we will take from Crixtren to Whitby.
