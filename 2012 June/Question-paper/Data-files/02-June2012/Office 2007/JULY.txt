JULY

Report for July Meeting

New Logo
I have had a new logo designed for the company. The new logo contains the company name added to the side of the plane. It has been designed by the new assistant I have just employed.

Flights to airports with longer runways
I have searched the database to find airports which can take larger airplanes. I am considering offering special deals to these airports so that we can fill more seats on the planes. This will generate more income for the company.

Special Offers
I have asked my new assistant to produce a web page about the special offers we will be making available to customers during September. The web page will be added to the company website during the next few weeks.  One special offer being considered is day return trips to Paris for £20. Another of the offers is a weekend break in Dublin with free accommodation.

Comparison of ticket prices
The graph shown here compares the income from our current pricing structure to the income which would be obtained if we changed to a fixed rate per kilometre travelled. As you can see some of the ticket prices would increase whilst others would decrease. However our most popular route to Dublin Airport in Ireland would not make as much income as it does presently.
