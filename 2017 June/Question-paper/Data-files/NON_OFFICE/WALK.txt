TITLE: PEMBROKESHIRE COAST WALK

INTRODUCTION:
The annual walking holiday this summer is to the beautiful South Wales county of Pembrokeshire. The holiday will be a wonderful mix of spectacular coastline and historic monuments. The total cost of the holiday is £650. Places are limited to the first 25 applicants. Please speak to Leonie if you wish to join the group as there are only a few places left.

WHAT YOU WILL NEED:
Some of the walks will be quite challenging so you will need to be fit and healthy. You will obviously need good walking shoes. We will be away for a full week so you will require enough clothes for the holiday. The weather in South Wales in August can be unpredictable so be prepared for strong winds and heavy showers as well as the possibility of bright sunshine.

SCHEDULE:
We will be setting off on the holiday from the Outgrove Park centre. The coach will leave at 9:00am on Saturday 5 August and return to Outgrove Park at about 10:00pm on Sunday 13 August. The full schedule is shown in this table.
