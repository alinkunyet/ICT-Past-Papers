Wildlife
The Pembrokeshire Coast National Park has a varied habitat, which supports a large number of species. As well as the greater horseshoe bat, there is a wide range of birds in the area including the barn owl and choughs. Ramsey Island and Skomer Islands, just off the coast, have large grey seal colonies and gannets, storm petrel and puffins. There are also many species of rare flowers.

Landmarks
Pembrokeshire in South Wales is rich in historical landmarks. As well as natural landmarks such as cliffs and arches there are many castles in the area. For example, Carew Castle has been an important location for 2000 years. The castle overlooks a large millpond and shows development from a Norman fort to a mediaeval country house. For family visits there is the Dinosaur Park or the Ty Canol Nature Reserve.
