Page Title - All About The Ski Run

Introductory Text
We are a family run ski school that first opened in December 1990.  We operate six ski schools – Alpbach, Innsbruck, Kitzbuhel, Mayrofen, Obergurgl and Saalbach.  Next year we are hoping to open four more.

We are celebrating 30 years of skiing and this year we have anniversary celebrations including our weekly ski show.

Would you like ski lessons but not in a group?  Yes, then book a private lesson.  We cater for beginners to learn the basics and advanced skiers who want to explore off-piste. Private lessons are suited to individual needs.
