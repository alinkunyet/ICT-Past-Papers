Edinburgh Castle
The castle is Scotland's leading tourist attraction and is open to visitors all year round. It is situated on top of an extinct volcano and overlooks Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland. There have been fortifications on the site since the Iron Age. In 1996, the 'Stone of Destiny' was returned to Scotland after many years in London. The stone has been used for centuries in the coronations of the kings and queens of Scotland and the United Kingdom. The stone is on display in Edinburgh Castle. 

Loch Ness
Loch Ness is the largest lake in Scotland. It is approximately 37 kilometres long. It is best known for alleged sightings of a sea monster known as 'Nessie'. Several boat trips are available that will allow you to take a tour of the loch. Overlooking the loch is Urquhart Castle, which was built in the thirteenth century. The castle is open to visitors all year round.
