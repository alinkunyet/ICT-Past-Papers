Clicka Colts
Clicka Colts are the newest team in the league but have quickly made an impression. We have been runners-up on two occasions and won the cup competition in our first season. We hope to continue our progress next season and win the championship.
We would be delighted to see new players join our squad. If you want to know more please contact Anne by phoning 020 915 4444 or emailing annefisher@emailme.org.ie

Dovea Dragons
Dovea Dragons had a disappointing season last year when we were unlucky with injuries. We hope to do better this season with our new squad. However we always have space for enthusiastic players of all abilities. We believe that taking part in a sporting way is more important than winning at all costs. 
If you want to know more about Dovea Dragons, please phone Franz on 020 913 8899 or email franzschmidt@doveacom.org.ie

Erry Eagles
Erry Eagles continue to be one of the most improved teams in the league. We have gradually improved from being at the bottom of the league to finishing in the top three for the last five seasons. This is mostly due to our excellent facilities and brilliant team spirit.
We would welcome any new players to our squad. Just phone Shaheen on 020 913 4455 or you can email shaheenkhan@trepankle.co.ie

Fantane Firestorm
Fantane Firestorm were unlucky last year to miss winning the championship when we were beaten in our last match after a strong run of five successive victories. On another day we might have won the league. However we were pleased after challenging so well throughout the season.
